# Exploring the Legacy of Redlining in Los Angeles
## EDS223 - Homework #2 Leela Dixit

This repository contains all code and outputs for the second homework assignment for EDS223 - Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing for the UCSB MEDS program. This project focuses on exploring legacy effects of redlining on environmental justice metrics and bird biodiversity data. 

# Data
Environmental justice data are sourced from an unofficial version of [EJ Screen](https://pedp-ejscreen.azurewebsites.net/), and environmental justice screening tool copied from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's tool. HOLC redlining data are sourced from [Mapping Inequality Project](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/data). Bird biodiversity data are sourced from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (data not publicly available).
